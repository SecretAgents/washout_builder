= Overview
WashOutBuilder is a  Soap Service Documentation generator (extends WashOut https://github.com/inossidabile/wash_out/)

The way WashOut is used is not modified, it just extends its functionality by providing html documentation

= Features

* Provides way of seeing the available services with links to documentation, endpoint and namespace
* Provides a human-readable HTML documentation generated  for each service that you write
* Can also create custom exception  classes and use them to send custom fault errors to the client application

= Screenshots (just an example)

= Requirements

1. {Ruby 1.9.x}[http://www.ruby-lang.org]
2. {Ruby on Rails}[http://rubyonrails.org].
3. {WashOut Gem v. 0.9.1}[https://github.com/inossidabile/wash_out]
4. {Nori Gem}[https://github.com/savonrb/nori]

= Compatibility

Rails >3.0 only. MRI 1.9, 2.0, JRuby (--1.9).

Ruby 1.8 is not officially supported since 0.5.3. We will accept further compatibilty pull-requests but no upcoming versions will be tested against it.

Rubinius support temporarily dropped since 0.6.2 due to Rails 4 incompatibility.

= Setup

Type the following from the command line to install:

  gem install washout_builder  

Add the following to your Gemfile:

  
  gem "washout_builder"

it will automatically install  also +wash_out+ gem  that is currently used

Or if you want this to be available only in development mode , you can do something like this inside the Gemfile:

gem 'wash_out'       # The WashOut gem  would be used also  in production 

group :development, :test do
  gem 'washout_builder'            # The documentation will only be available in development mode. 
end

Please read {release details}[https://github.com/bogdanRada/washout_builder/releases] if you are upgrading. We break backward compatibility between large ticks but you can expect it to be specified at release notes.

= Usage

The way soap_actions, or reusable types are defined or how the configuration is made using WashOut(https://github.com/inossidabile/wash_out)  haven't changed
You can still do everything that gem does .

when specifying the soap_action you can also pass a option for description and a list of exceptions that the method can raise at a certain moment.
The exception classes used must inherit from WashOut::SoapError and have accessible_attributes in order to show up in the documentation

Here is an example :

 soap_action "find",  :args   => {:number => :integer} , :return => :boolean, :raises => [MyFirstExceptionClass, MySecondExceptionClass ] , :description => "some description about this method to show in the documentation"


In order to see the documentation you must write something like this  in the routes (exactly like you would do when using only WashOut)

In the following file  +config/routes.rb+ you can put this configuration 

 WashOutSample::Application.routes.draw do
  wash_out :rumbas
  wash_out :my_other_service
 end

You can access the url +/washout+ and you will see a list with available services ( in our case there are only two : The RumbasController and MyOtherServiceController) with links to their documentation and where you can find the WSDL.

If you want to access directly the hml documentation that was generated for RumbasController  you can do that by accessing url +/rumbas/doc+ And the WSDL will be available at +/rumbas/wsdl+

= Setup  custom  exceptions

There is a class WashOut::SoapError
This class has as attributes :  a error_code, and a message. 

If you only  want to send a faultcode for your exception in the webservice application you can do this

 class MyException < WashOut::SoapError; end
 
and then when you raise it in the code you can do this 

  raise MyException.new (1001, "damn! found a error") . 

This exception is going to be catched by the gem and is going to send it to the client with the specified fault code and message

= Testing

To test, do the following:

1. cd to the gem root.
2. bundle install
3. bundle exec rake

== Contributing to washout_builder

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
